# cabal-extras

A tool suite to aid Haskell development using `cabal-install`.
There are four tools in this repository:
- `cabal-env`: An experiment on what `cabal install --lib` could be.
- `cabal-diff`: Compare API of different package versions
- `cabal-bundler`: (ab)use `cabal-install` solver to build standalone installation bundles
- `cabal-deps`: An experiment on what `cabal outdated` could be.

All tools are highly experimental, although I (Oleg Grenrus) use them daily.

There's also [`cabal-fmt`](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/cabal-fmt), a `.cabal` file formatter, but it's more standalone tool.
